        <h2 class=centeredH2>A Prophecy Foretold</h2>
        <p id="intro">The dawn of The Shaggs started with Austin Wiggin's mother who, when her son was young, predicted during a palmreading that he would marry a strawberry blonde woman, that he would have two daughters after she had died, and that his daughters would form a popular music group. The first two predictions came true and Austin set about making the third a reality as well. The sisters were withdrawn from school, handed instruments, and arranged music and vocal lessons.</p>
